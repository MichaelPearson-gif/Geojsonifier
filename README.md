# Geojsonifier

Here I have expanded my geojsonify tool that I made for my [Lost Pet Locator](https://github.com/MichaelPearson-gif/lost_pet), so that it can convert python libraries into different types of GeoJson objects.

# Getting Started
First make sure you have at least Python 3 downloaded onto your computer. Then clone this repository to download the files neccessary for the geojsonify tool.

# Built With
[Python](https://www.python.org/)
